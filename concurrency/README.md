# Concurrency
- allows to run multiple codes simultaneously
- requires the use of constructs such as threads and locks to perform synchronization and prevent deadlocks
- goroutines are functions that run concurrently with other functions
- `Mutex` (mutual excusion lock) 
    - this will make sure that only one goroutine can access the variable at any one time.
    - When one Goroutine gains the mutual exclusion lock, other Goroutines need to wait until the lock is released.
    - available in `sync` package
    - `Lock()` function locks the goroutines, after that goroutine is fully executed, it is unlocked by `Unlock()` function. 
- `atomic counters`
    - routine that allows to perform mathematical operations on variables one thread at a time
    - useful in synchronization algorithms
    - `AddInt64()` function automatically adds a value to the specified variable and returns the new value
- `Wait Groups` 
    - to know when the goroutine is fully executed
    - avaiable in `sync` package
    - `wg.Done()` // decrement 1 from the WaitGroup counter
    - `wg.Wait()` // blocks until WaitGroup counter is 0
    - `wg.Add(1)` // add 1 to the WaitGroup counter
